MindsDB enables you to build a chatbot, train it using your data, and integrate it into a chat application. All of this can be achieved through a user-friendly interface that doesn't require coding.

This guide will walk you through the process of building and training a chatbot using MindsDB's LLM UI.

## Setup

To access the LLM UI, click on the robot icon on the left menu. You'll see a welcome screen.

<p align="center">

</p>

Click on *Create AI Agent* to start.

In the *Settings* tab, you can provide information about engine and model that you want to use.

<Note>
Currently, we offer OpenAI models that require you to provide an API key.
</Note>

Optionally you can provide data in form of an URL to be used for training the chatbot.

<p align="center">

</p>

On completion, you'll see the `Model saved` message as below.

</p>

In the *Prompt* tab, you can set up a prompt message to give general directions to the chatbot. You can also define the `temperature` and `max_tokens` values that affect responses.

</p>

Low `temperature` values indicate that the model takes fewer risks and completions are more accurate and deterministic. On the other hand, high `temperature` values result in more diverse completions. And `max_tokens` value should be as close to the expected response size as possible.

Now we are ready to talk with the chatbot.

## Chat

The right half of the screen is a chat interface where you can submit messages and receive replies.

</p>

Now you can tweak the prompt parameters and test the responses.

## Publish

You can integrate this chatbot into chat applications.

<Note>
Currently, we support the Slack app.
</Note>

In the *Publish* tab, click on the *Connect* button.

</p>

Follow [this instruction](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) to connect your Slack and publish the chatbot.
