In this section, we present how to connect Shopify to MindsDB.

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage online stores. It is one of the leading e-commerce solutions, providing a wide range of tools and services to help entrepreneurs and businesses sell products and services online.

Data from Shopify can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models and chatbots using Products, Customers and Orders data, and make predictions relevant for businesses.

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `shop_url`: a required URL to your Shopify store.
- `access_token`: a required access token to use for authentication.

<Tip>
Here is how you can [create a Shopify access token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_aiC5oTNc&t=302s).
</Tip>

To connect your Shopify account to MindsDB, you must first create a new handler instance. You can do it by the following query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_..."
};
```

## Usage

Once you have created the database, you can query it like any other database. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM shopify_datasource.products
LIMIT 10;
```

Also, you can run more advanced queries and query the products or orders by status etc. For example:

```sql
SELECT  id, title
FROM shopify_datasource.products
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5
```
If you want to insert data into the store, run `INSERT INTO` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO shopify_datasource.customers(first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES 
('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')
```
