Within MindsDB, chatbots are [agents](/agents/agent) connected to some messaging interface.

Creating a chatbot requires the following parameters:

1. An [AI agent](/agents/agent) that comes with a model with a defined set of skills.
2. A connection to a chat app, like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams).

## How to work with chatbots

A chatbot can be created, deleted, queried, and updated using MindsDB SQL and REST API endpoints.

<Tab title="MindsDB SQL">

Here is how to interact with chatbots using MindsDB SQL:

* creating a chatbot:

    ```sql
    CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
    USING
        database = my_slack,
        agent = customer_support_agent,
        included_channels = ['support', 'help'],    -- Default is ALL
        excluded_channels = [],                     -- Default is none
        enable_dms = true,
        running = true;
    ```

    The parameter include:

    * `database` stores connection to a chat app (like [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) or [MS Teams](/integrations/app-integrations/microsoft-teams)) that should be created with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
    * `agent` is an [AI agent](/agents/agent) created with the `CREATE AGENT` command. It consists of an AI model trained for the specific use case.
    * `included_channels` and `excluded_channels` are optional and store channel names where the bot will or will not respond.
    * `enable_dms` is the initially supported mode of talking to a chatbot. A chatbot responds to direct messages.
    * `running` indicates whether or not to start the chatbot upon creation.

* deleting an chatbot:

    ```sql
    DROP CHATBOT my_chatbot;
    ```

You can query all chatbots using these commands:

```sql
SELECT * FROM chatbots;
```

<Tab title="REST API">

Here is how to interact with agents using REST API endpoints:

* `GET /projects/<project_name>/chatbots` - gets all chatbots created by the user.
* `GET /projects/<project_name>/chatbots/<chatbot_name>` - gets a chatbot by name.
* `PUT /projects/<project_name>/chatbots/<chatbot_name>` - updates a chatbot with new settings, creating it if it doesn't exist.
* `POST /projects/<project_name>/chatbots` - creates a new chatbot.
* `DELETE /projects/<project_name>/chatbots/<chatbot_name>` - deletes a chatbot by name.
