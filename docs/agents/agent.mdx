MindsDB provides an easy way to create AI agents that leverage customizable skills such as knowledge bases, text-to-SQL, and more.

AI agents use a conversational model (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Command, etc.) from Langchain utilizing [tools as skills](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) to respond to user input. Users can customize AI agents with their own prompts to fit their use cases.

A [chatbot](/agents/chatbot) can be thought of as a specialized agent thatâ€™s connected to some messaging interface.

## How to work with AI agents

An agent can be created, deleted, queried, and updated using MindsDB SQL and REST API endpoints.

<Tab title="MindsDB SQL">

Here is how to interact with agents using MindsDB SQL:

* creating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    CREATE AGENT support_agent
    USING
    model = customer_support_model,    -- Should be created with CREATE MODEL
    skills = [
    {
        type: 'knowledge_base',
        params: {
        source: 'my_knowledge_base' -- Should be created with CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE
        }
    }
    ];
    ```

* deleting an AI agent:

    ```sql
    DROP AGENT support_agent;
    ```

* updating an AI agent:

    ```sql
    UPDATE AGENT support_agent
    SET
    model = new_customer_support_model,
    skills = [...]; -- Overwrites existing skills
    ```

You can query all agents using these commands:

```sql
SELECT * FROM agents;
```

<Tab title="REST API">

Here is how to interact with agents using REST API endpoints:

* `GET /projects/<project_name>/agents` - gets all agents created by the user
* `GET /projects/<project_name>/agents/<agent>` - gets an agent by name or ID
* `PUT /projects/<project_name>/agents/<agent_name>` updates agent with new settings
* `POST /projects/<project_name>/agents` - creates a new agent
* `DELETE /projects/<project_name>/agent/<agent_name>` - deletes an agent by name or ID

## How to create skills for AI agents

A skill can be either a `text-to-sql` type or a `knowledge_base` type. An agent can have one or more skills.

<Tab title="MindsDB SQL">

Here is how to create and delete skills using MindsDB SQL:

* creating, inserting into, and updating a knowledge base:

    ```sql
    CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
    USING
        model = model_name,
        storage = datasource.storage_table; -- this parameter is optional

    INSERT INTO my_knowledge_base
        SELECT id, text AS content FROM datasource.data_table;

    UPDATE KNOWLEDGE BASE my_knowledge_base
    ON id
    FROM (SELECT id, text AS content FROM datasource.data_table);
    ```

* creating skills:

    ```sql
    CREATE SKILL my_support_skill
    USING
        type = 'knowledge_base',
        params = {
            source: 'my_knowledge_base'
        };

    CREATE SKILL text_to_sql_skill
    USING
        type = 'text_to_sql',
        database = 'example_db',
        tables = ['sales_data'];
    ```

* deleting an AI agent:

    ```sql
    DROP SKILL my_support_skill;

    DROP SKILL text_to_sql_skill;
    ```

You can query all agents using these commands:

```sql
SELECT * FROM skills;
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">

Here is how to interact with agents using REST API endpoints:

* `GET /projects/<project_name>/skills` - gets all skills created by the user (allow params to filter by agent)
* `GET /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skill_name>` - gets a skill by name or ID
* `PUT /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skill_name>` - updates skill with new params
* `POST /projects/<project_name>/skills` - creates a new skill
* `DELETE /projects/<project_name>/skills/<skills>` - deletes a skill by name or ID
