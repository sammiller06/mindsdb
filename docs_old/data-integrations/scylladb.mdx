This is the implementation of the ScyllaDB data handler for MindsDB.

[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) is an open-source distributed NoSQL wide-column data store. It was designed to be compatible with Apache Cassandra while achieving significantly higher throughputs and lower latencies.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `scylla-driver` Python library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address of the ScyllaDB.
* `port` is the port to use when connecting.
* `user` is the user to authenticate.
* `password` is the password to authenticate the user.
* `keyspace` is the keyspace to connect to. It is a top level container for tables.
* `protocol_version` is not required, and default to 4.

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/scylla_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the ScyllaDB server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE scylladb_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'scylladb',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user@mindsdb.com",
    "password": "pass",
    "secure_connect_bundle": "/home/zoran/Downloads/secure-connect.zip"
  };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM scylladb_datasource.keystore.example_table
LIMIT 10;
```
